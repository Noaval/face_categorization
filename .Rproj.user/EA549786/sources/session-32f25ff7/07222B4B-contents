[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a powerful and flexible document processing tool.
Quarto files (`*.qmd`) are a basic markdown files[^1], with 2 major differences.

[^1]: It actually uses a _flavor_ of markdown called Pandoc Markdown,
    that has some [extra features](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).

# 1. We can *execute* real code

This code *chunk* will run the code, and print its outputs:

```{r first_chunk}
# R code:
z <- c(1, 2, 3)
mean(z)
```

Code chunks are executed sequentially in the same environment.

```{r}
median(z)
```

We can also add inline mini-chunks,
so we can say that the smallest value in the vector *z* is `r min(z)`.

Quarto has many engines that can be used, 
including R, python, sql, and many more...

```{python}
# Python code:
A = [1, 2, 3.14, 4]
LL = {'Name': 'David'}

print([i**2 for i in A])
```

Make a new chunk with `ctrl+alt+I`.


# 2. Rendering = Knitting + Pandoc

We can turn `.qmd` files into many types of outputs, the most popular being:

- html
- pdf
- word
- ...

But there are also presentations, blogs, books, and more and more and more...

This is done in two steps:

1. The `qmd` file is converted to an `md` file by _Quarto_ (and the `knitr` R package or others).
2. The `md` file is converted to the desired output by [_Pandoc_](https://pandoc.org/).

## The `YAML` header

_This_ file will become a plain HTML doc, as set in the `YAML` header
(that also has the table of contents -- `toc` -- setting turned on).
But there are many templates and expansion packages for `*.qmd` that can be used! 
See [here](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/) and [here](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/)!

## Code chunk options

We can control many aspects of the code chunk using chunk options.

For example, we can suppress the execution of the chunk:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mean(x)
```

We can also add options inside the chunk with the hashpipe (`#|`;
this is the preferred option):

```{r}
#| eval: false
mean(x)
```

We can hide the results while showing (and executing) the code:

```{r}
#| results: hide
z
```

We can show the results but hide the code:

```{r}
#| echo: false
z
```

There are *many* options, and you will learn to use them as you go...
