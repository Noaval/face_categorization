# What is Markdown?

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language
for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

it is intended to be used as a simple, 
text-only based *literate coding* language. 
This means that even without any rendering (i.e., in its raw form),
it is still easy to *read* (by humans).

# Some basics

To break a line, 
you
must
end 
a
line
with
two
whitespaces,  
Or you can leave an empty line.

## This is a level 2 header

The number of `#`s determines the depth of the heading.

## Lists

This is a numbered list:

1. Item 1
2. New item
3. Item 2

But so is this:

1. Item 1
1. Item 2


This is an un-numbered list:

- This is **bold text**
- This is *italicized text* [^1]
- This is ~~strikethrough text~~
- This is `inline code` [^2]

[^1]: There is no built-in underline format
[^2]: This is another footnote

We can also nest lists:

1. Item 1
    - sub list
    - sub list 2
2. item 2
    i. Roman numerals...
    i. etc...

## Tables

This is a Markdown table:

| Name                  | Email                  | Year of Birth |
|-----------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| Mattan S. Ben-Shachar | mattansb@msbstats.info | 1989          |
| Aristotle             |                        | 384 BC        |

This is the same table:

| Name | Email | Year of Birth |
|---|---|---|
| Mattan S. Ben-Shachar | mattansb@msbstats.info | 1989 |
| Aristotle | | 384 BC |

## Code blocks

```
a <- "a"
mean(a)
```

---

(That is a separator line)

We will see how to ***use*** real code in Quarto!
